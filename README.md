# **Heightmaster**
A Roblox plugin to import heightmaps and colourmaps, with more control than the standard importer.

Heightmaster is a plugin that allows a user to select a heightmap image, and optional colormap to texture the terrain with materials. The plugin gives more tools and options for importing the terrain compared to the default importer, and allows you to import heightmaps directly from the local file, negating the need to upload the image to Roblox's server first - credits to Clonetrooper1019 for creating this library, you can find out more [here](https://github.com/CloneTrooper1019/Roblox-PNG-Library).

# Installation

You can install the plugin directly through Studio, [here.](https://www.roblox.com/library/2768461796)

Alternativley, you can compile the plugin yourself. This is done by using [Rojo](https://rojo.space), simply sync this project with an empty place in Studio, and save the plugin as a local plugin to your Plugins Folder.

# How to use

In order to use heightmaster, it's assumed you understand how to create an existing heightmap / colormap - if not, there are plenty of documentation you can find out online.
