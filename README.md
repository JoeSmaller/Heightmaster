# **Heightmaster**
A Roblox plugin to import heightmaps and colourmaps, with more control than the standard importer.

Heightmaster is a plugin that allows a user to select a heightmap image, and optional colormap to texture the terrain with materials. The plugin gives more tools and options for importing the terrain compared to the default importer, and allows you to import heightmaps directly from the local file, negating the need to upload the image to Roblox's server first.
